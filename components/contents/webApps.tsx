      <p>
        Banner Eyewear was developed so people could create and purchase 3D
        printed sunglasses. The create page has an advanced user interface,
        where text is warped and extruded, rendering a realistic 3D
        representation of the real product. Just type text and see that text
        warped to fit the temples. You can also change the font, ear tip icons,
        and colors.&nbsp;
